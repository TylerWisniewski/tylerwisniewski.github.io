*Non-Disclosure Agreement: I will only disclose non-proprietary information regarding my work at General Motors. All images are public knowledge.*

I worked at SpaceX as a Graduate Propulsion Manufacturing Engineer from May 2025 to August 2025. I was a member of the Raptor Foundry Team, which creates all the cast parts for the Starship Raptor Rocket Engines. My work involved designing and manufacturing hardware and tooling for the production of Investment Cast Raptor rocket engine parts.

For Investment Cast parts manufacturing, one needs to print a pattern upon which the ceramic mold will be made around. My main project was designing and manufacturing an Electro-Mechanical Pattern Transfer Cart to move these patterns around the Print Lab to various work stations as they are be prepared for shelling. The patterns are big, heavy, and coated in toxic resin so moving these around safely, effectively, and qiickly is critical to meeting production targets. I implemented this new cart to replace four existing specialized, but limited carts, and integrated it seamlessly into production with zero downtime. This improved the Foundry Print Lab's pattern offload and throughput speed by over 50%, which will save the company over $30,000 per year in technician labor.

Additionally, I did some Build Reliabilty Engineering work examining, analyzing, and clearing nearly 100 flagged Raptor V2 Engines using Polyworks and Ansys to validate part thicknesses, ultimately clearing them for flight. This work helped push us to a very succesful Flight 10 and (hopefully; finges crossed) successful Flight 11 and 12 launches in the coming months.

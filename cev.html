<p>
    Cornell Electric Vehicles (CEV) is a fully student run project team dedicated to building autonomous, hyper-efficient electric cars.
    Our deeply knowledgeable interdisciplinary organization operates at the pace of a startup and has repeatedly produced industry-grade vehicles. 
    Having placed highly at Shell Eco-Marathon Americas, we are a respected team operating at the limits of emergent technologies.
    Endeavoring to integrate level 2 autonomy into our vehicles reflects our determination to continue forging at the leading edge of innovation.

<h3>Leadership Responsibilities</h3>

<p>As the Full Team Lead, I am in charge of 65+ students and responsible for the vehicle's Mechanical, Electrical, Data Aquisition and Analysis, and Autonomous systems.  
    To keep things running smoothly, myself and subeam leads set up weekly system meetings and preliminary, critical, alumni, and final design reviews to provide consistent and widespread technical feedback. 
    We also kept the team organized with both full-team GANTT charts and individual work logs. Lastly, I redesigned our CAD sharing system and our documentation protocols to push for more consistent documentation to aid future members.
</p>

<p>I worked with the other team leads (Mechanical, Electrical, Data A&A, Autonomy, Operations) to ensure smooth design and manufacturing of all systems, testing procedures, and 
    vehicle integration. Excellent time managemnt and communication skills were key to helping this team run smoothly and efficiently!
</p>

<h4>Additional Roles</h4>

<p>
    In adddition to my role as Team Lead this year, I am also serving as Machining Lead and completing my Senior Design for CEV. As 1 of 10 Undergraduate student selected to
    become a "Blue Apron" (the highest level of Machining Mastery at Cornell) last year, I'm the most senior machinist on our team and I have 200+ hours in the shop. Not only
    am I charge of red lining and validating all shop drawings for our team's packed manufacturing cycle and redesign
    dozens of parts to be more manufacturable. I'm also the sole individual responsible for all of our CNC Machinied
    parts. This includes our wheel hubs, steering knuckles, axel supports, driveshafts, and more!
</p>

<p>
    For my senior design, I'm designing an autonomous Dihedral synchro-helix actuation
    door system for our upcoming vehcile. This involves mechanical design, manufacturing, sensor integration, and PCB design.

<h3>Chassis Lead</h3>

<span class="caption text-muted">Chassis Surface Model for UC24</span>

<p>I spent my first year on the Chassis Team manufacturing the structural and aerodynamic parts our chassis. These 
</p>

<p>As a member and later co-lead of the Drivetrain subteam, I focused first on doing calculations to select the motor for the vehicle, and then on redesigning the Chain and Sprocket transmission not only to 
    optimize it for manufacturing (which was without a doubt an extremely iterative process, even into the manufacturing phase!), but also for cost and weight.
</p>

<h4>Motor Selection Process</h4>

<p>Selecting the motor meant not only doing calculations on the motor torque, wheel RPM, and other physical characteristics needed to power the vehicle through the 10-mile race- but also working with and 
    electrical specifications and limits that had to be met. This involved, first and foremost, understanding the principle forces that would be acting on the car, in particular rolling resistance versus drag- where the former had more 
    of an impact on startup, and the latter at steady-state conditions.
</p>

<p>Using this data, we were able to select an appropriate 24V Brushless DC motor for the job. However, a big lesson learned came from understanding the effiency not only of the motor, but also of energy losses 
    within the vehicle's mechanical systems... We ended up later swapping the 24V motor for a stronger, 48V motor in order to meet speed requirements to finish the race on time and improve factor of safety.

<h4>Chain and Sprocket Design, Differential</h4>

<p>
    After the motor was selected, I worked on redesigning the chain and sprocket transmission, as well as its interfaces with the differential, which we as a team selected over a belt drive for efficiency and load-bearing capability.
</p>

<p>
    It was an interesting challenge to reduce weight of the part without sacrificing functionality and strength. I also had to look into bearing selection, both for supporting parts and for the 
    sprocket itself, which had a one-way bearing in the center so that torque transmission was only allowed in one direction to allow a "burn and coast" strategy. A technical report can be found below.

<h3>Manufacturing Lead</h3>

<p>
    As part of the drivetrain work that I did, I optimized several parts for manufacturing once that process began. It was a large learning curve for us all- 
    it was one thing to design parts, but another to go into the machine shop and do it ourselves.
</p>

<p>
    As the most-trained member of the team in the machine shop, and one of only a handful of students selected to be CNC machinists in the school, I took on the role of 
    manufacturing lead on CEV, the first to do so. Not only did I organize machine shop shifts and mentor new members to help them get comfortable in the shop, I also helped to redesign 
    dozens of parts to be more manufacturable, getting rid of complex features that were there largely for looks in order to make more parts easily machinable for new members on a 
    manual mill or lathe, as well as save time.
</p>

<p>
    This role taught me tons about design for manufacturing, which I turned into onboarding education for future members. But it also gave me necessary confidence in 
    the machine shop that would help me in industry/internships later on. See my machining portfolio back on the homepage for photos of specific parts
</p>

<h3>Autonomy - Auto-Braking Project</h3>

<p>
    One of my first projects on the team involved working with a partner to spearhead the team's autonomous braking. We researched and prototyped several designs, both in terms of 
    mechanical brakes and an autonomous method of actuating the hydraulic brake pedal. We ended up deciding on the latter, which taught me about selection of motors/linear actuators.
</p>

<p>
    While I did not carry this project beyond the prototyping phase (this was when I switched to Drivetrain), I stayed on as a 
    consulant of sorts, and the team finally carried out full Level-1 autonomy across electrical, mechanical, and software in January 2024 using many aspects of the 
    system I originally designed. It also gave me testing experience.

<h3>Carbon Footprint Reduction</h3>
<p>For submission for an award in the 2024 Shell Eco-Marathon, I wrote a proposal for a Carbon-Footprint reduction plan involving having the team 
    use carbon fiber scraps to design carbon-fiber rims for a future vehicle which would not obly improve performance, but reduce waste.
</p>

<p>The paper won 2nd Place, and a $1500 prize. The PDF can be found below:</p>

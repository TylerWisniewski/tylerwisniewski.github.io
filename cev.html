<p>
    Cornell Electric Vehicles (CEV) is a fully student run project team dedicated to building autonomous, hyper-efficient electric cars.
    Our deeply knowledgeable interdisciplinary organization operates at the pace of a startup and has repeatedly produced industry-grade vehicles.
    Having placed highly at Shell Eco-Marathon Americas, we are a respected team operating at the limits of emergent technologies.
    Endeavoring to integrate level 2 autonomy into our vehicles reflects our determination to continue forging at the leading edge of innovation. Our team's website is https://www.cornellelectricvehicles.org/.

<h3>Leadership Responsibilities</h3>

<p>
    As the Full Team Lead, I am in charge of 65+ students and responsible for the vehicle's Mechanical, Electrical, Data Aquisition and Analysis, and Autonomous systems.
    To keep things running smoothly, myself and subeam leads set up weekly system meetings and preliminary, critical, alumni, and final design reviews to provide consistent and widespread technical feedback.
    We also keep the team organized with both full-team GANTT charts and individual work logs. Also, I redesigned our CAD sharing system and our documentation protocols to push for more consistent documentation to aid future members.
</p>

<p>
    I worked with the other team leads (Mechanical, Electrical, Data A&A, Autonomy, Operations) to ensure smooth design and manufacturing of all systems, testing procedures, and
    vehicle integration. Excellent time managemnt and communication skills were key to helping this team run smoothly and efficiently!
</p>

<h4>Additional Roles</h4>

<p>
    In adddition to my role as Team Lead this year, I am also serving as Machining Lead and completing my Senior Design for CEV. As 1 of 10 Undergraduate student selected to
    become a "Blue Apron" (the highest level of Machining Mastery at Cornell) last year, I'm the most senior machinist on our team and I have 200+ hours in the shop. Not only
    am I charge of red lining and validating all shop drawings for our team's packed manufacturing cycle and redesign
    dozens of parts to be more manufacturable. I'm also the sole individual responsible for all of our CNC Machinied
    parts. This includes our wheel hubs, steering knuckles, axel supports, driveshafts, and more!
</p>

<p>
    For my senior design, I'm designing an autonomous Dihedral synchro-helix actuation
    door system for our upcoming vehcile. This involves mechanical design, manufacturing, sensor integration, and PCB design.

<h3>Chassis Lead</h3>

<span class="caption text-muted">Chassis Surface Model for UC24</span>

<p>
    As Chassis Lead I oversaw the manufacturing of the Monocoque and Aerodyanic Chassis Components for the UC24 vehicle, the Aerodyanamic and Structural Design of the UC25 Chassis, and the integration
    process of all mechanical, electrical and autonomy hardware systems. Our UC24 Model was designed in Autodesk Inventor using Surfacing tools, but I lead the switch to Autodesk Alias (A top Automotive Surface Modeling Program)
    for the design of the UC25 Vehicle. Through an iteritive design process, alterning model parameters and analysing aerodynamic performance using Ansys Fluent Computational Fluid Mechanics, I was able to reduce drag by
    6% while also altering many parts for easier manufacturablity with specific surfaces for Autonomous Sensor Mounting. We then analyse and optimize our structural components using Ansys ACP and Mechanical.

<p>
    Impressed by my Computational Fluid Dynamic work for CEV, Dr. Bhaskaran and I are reowrking the MAE 5230: Intermediate Fluid Dynamics final project into a simplified version of my design process for the UC25 last year.

    This year, we're already undeway for Chassis Manufacturing, preparing our Baseplate Mold for Layup via Vacuum Infusion in October and our Bulkhead for November. Then, we'll manufacture all of our Aerodynamic Parts during JANFAB!'

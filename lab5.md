## Prelab
The purpose of this lab was to implement closed loop control through PID controllers. The state I controlled was speed, and I used the TOF sensors to stop a set distance from the wall. PID stands for proportional, integral, derivative control. 

$$ u(t)= k_p * e(t) + k_i * \int_0^t e(t) dt + k_d  *\frac{d }{dt}e(t)$$

### Bluetooth Communication Setup
For this lab, I implemented a robust Bluetooth communication system to send and receive data between the Artemis and my computer. This was essential for debugging and tuning the PID controller. I tried to use a flag-based system to start and stop the PID control loop remotely, but kept encountering errors or inconsistency. Instead I ended up adding a Stop PID function which would cut power to the motors. In practice, I didn't end up using this at all though and just unplugged the power. 

```cpp
case START_PID:
{
    // to fill in later
}

case STOP_PID:
{
  PID_ON = false;
            
            pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
            pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);

            pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
            pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);

            analogWrite(motor1a,0);
            analogWrite(motor1b,0);

            analogWrite(motor2a,0);
            analogWrite(motor2b,0);
}
```

Additionally, I implemented a helper function for driving in a straight line. I also added a stop driving variation if I set dir=0 or at least not +/-1:
```c
void driveStraight(int dir, int PWM){
  if (dir == 1){
    //drive forward
    analogWrite(motor1a, 0);
    analogWrite(motor1b, int(PWM*cal));
    analogWrite(motor2a, PWM);
    analogWrite(motor2b, 0);
  }
  else if (dir == -1){
    //drive backward
    analogWrite(motor1a, int(PWM*cal));
    analogWrite(motor1b, 0);
    analogWrite(motor2a, 0);
    analogWrite(motor2b, PWM);
  }
  else {
    analogWrite(motor1a, 0);
    analogWrite(motor1b, 0);
    analogWrite(motor2a, 0);
    analogWrite(motor2b, 0);
  }
}
```

## Lab Tasks
P/I/D Discussion
I started with a Proportional (P) controller to control the robot's speed and position relative to the wall. The P controller calculates the error as the difference between the target distance (305 mm) and the current distance measured by the ToF sensor. The PWM output is proportional to this error.

I had a ton of trouble with this part of the lab. Many errors and code rewrites, memory issues, and I even reworked my mounting structure for my ToF sensors. After much simplification, I was able to achieve a pretty effective P control setup using the following code. 

```c
case PID_BEGIN:{

    int count = 0;
    int distance = 0;
    int pwm=0;
    int dir= 1;
    int err=0;

    while (currMillisTOF - prevMillisTOF <= 10000) {
        distanceSensor1.startRanging();

        if (distanceSensor1.checkForDataReady()) {
        time_array[count] = (int)millis();

        //Serial.print("tof: ");
        distance = distanceSensor1.getDistance();
        distanceSensor1.clearInterrupt();
        distanceSensor1.stopRanging();
        //Serial.print(distance);
        TOF_array[count] = distance;

        err = (int)(distance - targetDist );
        pwm= (int) (kp*err);

        //Serial.print("    dir: ");

        if (err > 0){
            dir=1;
            //Serial.print(" forward    ");

        }

        else if (err < 0){
            dir= -1;
            //Serial.print(" backward    ");
        }
        pwm= abs(pwm);

        if (pwm < pwmMin ) pwm = pwmMin;
        if (pwm > pwmMax ) pwm = pwmMax;

        //Serial.println(pwm);

        driveStraight(dir, pwm);
        PWM_array[count] = (dir*pwm);
        //currMillisTOF = millis();
        count++;
        }
    }

    driveStraight(0, 0); //stop driving

    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        tx_estring_value.clear();
        tx_estring_value.append(time_array[i]);
        tx_estring_value.append(" | ");
        tx_estring_value.append(TOF_array[i]);
        tx_estring_value.append(" | ");
        tx_estring_value.append(PWM_array[i]);
        tx_characteristic_string.writeValue(tx_estring_value.c_str());
    }
        delay(10000);
        driveStraight(-1, 100);
        delay(1000);
        driveStraight(0, 0); //stop driving
        delay(10000);
}
```

After tuning, I found that a Kp value of 0.07-5 worked well for me. Higher values caused signifigant overshoot where the robot would sometimes hit the wall. As such I added a bolt to front of my car so I don't damage the ToF sensor. I also added a line to drive my car back to me after I was done. 

I also added a lengthy delay to the end so I can pick up and turn off my car. For some reason, my car would automatically start running random case statements after I was already done. I never called them myself. I don't know why this is happening and I haven't found a solution, but it's not that disruptive so I've just decided to live with it for now. I hope I can figure it out in lab.

Next, I added an Integral (I) term to eliminate steady-state error. The integral term accumulates the error over time and adjusts the PWM output accordingly:

This did not work well initially. 
```c
pid_dt= time_array[count]-time_array[count-1];
errP = (int)(distance - targetDist );
errI= (int) errI+ err*pid_dt;

pwm= (int) (kp*errP)+(ki*errI);
```

*PI is not looking good* 

Eventually I found and fixed my bug, but then got hit with some strong integrator windup.

*Integrator Windup* 

![ToF+pwm plot](/images/portfolio/fast-robot/5windup.png)  
*Figure 5: Plot of ToF and PWM vs time showcasing Integrator Windup*

I set Ki = 0.02 to minimize steady-state error without significantly slowing down the system.

Range and Sampling Time
The ToF sensor was configured to operate in long-distance mode (up to 3.6 meters) with a sampling rate of approximately 50 Hz. This provided sufficient accuracy for the task. The control loop ran every 40 ms, ensuring timely updates to the motor PWM values.

Graphs and Data
Below are the plots of distance (mm) and PWM vs. time for different Kp values:

## 5000-Level Tasks
### Integrator Windup Protection
To prevent integrator windup, I capped the integral term at Â±200. This ensured that the integral term did not dominate the control output, especially during large errors:
```c
if(Iterm > 200) Iterm = 200;
else if(Iterm < -200) Iterm = -200;
```

*Figure 7: Integrator windup protection*

### Linear Extrapolation
I implemented linear extrapolation to estimate the robot's position when new ToF data was not available. This allowed the control loop to run faster than the ToF sensor's sampling rate:

```c
if(i > 1) {
  float d1 = distance1_data[i-2]; float d2 = distance1_data[i-1];
  float t1 = time_data[i-2]; float t2 = time_data[i-1];
  float dxdt = (d2 - d1) / (t2 * 0.001 - t1 * 0.001);
  float dx = dxdt * (millis() - t2);
  float error = (d2 + dx) - TARGET;
  float pwm = Kp * error;
}
```
*Figure 8: Linear extrapolation implementation*

## Conclusion
This lab provided hands-on experience with PID control and highlighted the importance of tuning gains, managing sampling rates, and implementing safeguards like integrator windup protection. The robot successfully stopped at the target distance of 304 mm from the wall, demonstrating the effectiveness of the PID controller.

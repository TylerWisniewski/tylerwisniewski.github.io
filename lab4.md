## Prelab  

### Motor Driver Wiring  
I began by wiring the H-Bridge motor drivers according to the datasheet, ensuring each pin was correctly connected. My previous wiring diagram from Lab 3 contained an errorâ€”it used the VMM pins, which do not serve a functional purpose. Below is the corrected wiring setup:

**Circuit Diagram:**  
![Wiring Diagram](/images/portfolio/fast-robot/4wd.jpg)  
*Figure 1: Updated wiring diagram*  

The A and B input/output pins were coupled to provide sufficient current to the motors. Each board powers one motor, which in turn drives two wheels. Without daisy-chaining the pins, the current would be halved, reducing motor performance.  


### Battery Discussion  
Each motor driver and the Artemis are powered separately by **650 mAh batteries**. The motors require significantly more current than the Artemis, and separate power paths reduce signal noise.

## PWM Tests  

Before soldering my drivers to the motors, I tested the motor drivers to verify bidirectional functionality. Applying **HIGH to one input and LOW to the other** should drive the motor in either direction.  

I supplied **3.7V** to the drivers, although they accept up to **10V**. The OUT1 and OUT2 pins were probed using an oscilloscope while running a PWM loop. I referenced code from **Bhadra Bejoy (2023)** to increment the PWM from **0 to 255**.  

```cpp
#define motor1a 2
#define motor1b 3

#define motor2a 5
#define motor2b 6


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
  delay(15000);
}

void loop() {

  for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
    //right wheels
    analogWrite(motor1a,i);
    delay(200);

  }
}
```

## Testing Individual Motors  

After soldering, I confirmed that each motor functioned properly by applying power and running the following test script:  

```cpp
#define motor1a 2
#define motor1b 3

#define motor2a 5
#define motor2b 6


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
  delay(5000);
}

void loop() {

    analogWrite(motor1a,200);
    analogWrite(motor2b,0);
    delay(1000);

    analogWrite(motor1a,0);
    analogWrite(motor2b,200);
    delay(1000); 
}
```

## Open Loop Control  

### Installation  
I integrated all components, ensuring **braided cables** to reduce noise and securing wires with tape. I mounted **one TOF sensor in the front and one in the side**.  

![Wiring Diagram](/images/portfolio/fast-robot/4label.png)  
*Figure 4: Fully wired robot*  

### System Drift  
To evaluate drift, I ran the robot foward, varying time and PWM signal around a dozen times

### Adding a Calibration Constant  
To compensate for drift, I introduced a **calibration factor** to adjust the left motor's PWM. I manually tuned this value through trial and error. The final calibration factor was **0.82**, which significantly reduced drift.  

```cpp
#define motor1a 2
#define motor1b 3
#define m1pwm 45


#define motor2a 5
#define motor2b 6
#define m2pwm 55


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
  delay(15000);
}

void loop() {

  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,m1pwm);

  analogWrite(motor2a,m2pwm);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);

  delay(2800);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
   delay(30000);

}

```

## More Open Loop control

Through tests, I was able to execute a pretty good 180 degree turn.

## 5000 Level Tasks
### Consider what frequency analogWrite generates. Is this adequately fast for these motors? Can you think of any benefits to manually configuring the timers to generate a faster PWM signal?

```c
//right motor
#define motor1a 2
#define motor1b 3
#define m1pwm 45


//left motor
#define motor2a 5
#define motor2b 6
#define m2pwm 55
int cnt =0;
unsigned long timer;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
  delay(15000);
  timer = micros();
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(motor1b,55);
  Serial.println(micros()-(timer));
  timer=micros();
  
}

```
![Wiring Diagram](/images/portfolio/fast-robot/4timer.png)  
*Figure 2: Output of above code*

This code gave an output of 5100 microseconds for each signal. This would mean a delay of ~5ms. This is much lower than the delay induced by the IMU and ToF sensors. Thus, I think think this is an acceptable range since we will still be acting or reacting faster than our sensor input.

If I increase the frequency, I'd reduce noise and have more control over the motors. However, if I increase the frequency too much, I may overclock the transistor (probably mosfets) and they could either grow inefficient or break. 


### Lowest PWM value whlie rolling

I wrote a program that starts slightly above the PWM signal neccessary to overcome friction and then had each signal decrease each second. This by slowly ticking down values, I eventually found my robot moving continuously with **22/255 for my left motor and 32/255 for my right motor**.

I wouldn't reccomend others follow this method exactly as I ended up running up and down a hallway holding my laptop close to my robot so I could get serial outputs of the current PWM signal and then cut power once the robot stopped. I ended up with a slightly sore back.

```c
//right motor
#define motor1a 2
#define motor1b 3
#define m1pwm 45


//left motor
#define motor2a 5
#define motor2b 6
#define m2pwm 55
int cnt=0;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(motor1a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor1b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor1a,0);
  analogWrite(motor1b,0);

  pinMode(motor2a, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(motor2b, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(motor2a,0);
  analogWrite(motor2b,0);
  delay(15000);
}

void loop() {
  analogWrite(motor1b,55-cnt);
  analogWrite(motor2a,45-cnt);
  Serial.print("motor1b(left): ");
  Serial.print(45-cnt);
  Serial.print("   motor2a(right): ");
  Serial.println(55-cnt);

  delay(2000);
  cnt++;
}

```

    For the final project in MAE 3780: Mechatronics, we were tasked with creating a robot that ran on an ATmega microcontroller and autonomously
    collected blocks while competing against another robot from our class. All the code was written in C, and we used a color sensor to determine what side of the
    board we were on and prevent driving out of bounds with QTI sensors to detect the borders. I also designed and bent all sheet metal parts including the arms and plow

## Executive Summary
This project aimed to democratize high-performance surf equipment by designing and manufacturing carbon fiber fins at a fraction of the market cost. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for aerodynamic optimization and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for structural validation, I developed a manufacturing process using forged carbon fiber and 3D-printed split molds.

Key Results:
- Cost Reduction: Produced for **$11.16/set** (vs. $150+ market rate).
- Performance: Validated Safety Factor of 1.73 under hydrodynamic loads.
- Material Strength: Achieved tensile yield strength of 358 MPa (exceeding industry baseline).

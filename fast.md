## Let me introduce myself
I am a UG Senior/Early MEng student at Cornell University studying Mechanical Engineering. Outside of the classroom, I spent time with CEV and I like rock climbing.

*Note: I am actively taking this course, lab pages will be updated throughout the semester as I complete them.*

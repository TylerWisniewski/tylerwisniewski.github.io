## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Tyler an BS/ME stduent at Cornell studying Mechanical Engineering. So far I've worked on medieval siege weapons, surfboard fins, autonomus/hyper-efficient cars, quantum computers, all-terrian light-duty trucks, and other stuff. This summer I'll be building rocket engines


I'm very active on campus participating in and holding leadership positions in the following organizations on campus.

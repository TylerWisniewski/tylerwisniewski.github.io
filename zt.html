           <h3>Hexagonal Boron Nitride Characterization</h3>

           <p>
            The first project aimed to identify and catalog the out-of-plane thermal properties of the 2D Material, Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN). The ultimate goal of this project is to gauge the efficacy of h-BN as a potential source to mitigate the spread of vibrational energy in quantum computers. Superconducting qubits are an up-and-coming platform for quantum technologies. The subsequent phases of implementing quantum error correction and large-scale quantum computing are limited primarily by qubit coherence time. One source of decoherence arises from high-energy non-equilibrium phonons, or excess vibrational energy. Our work aims to reveal the underlying processes that govern phonon-induced decoherence in superconducting qubits. We will use the fundamental knowledge gained to design novel mitigation strategies and evaluate their effectiveness by fabricating and characterizing the performance of superconducting qubit devices.
          </p>  
          <p>
            Hexagonal Boron Nitride is a fascinating case, as its thermal conductivity in its own plane is widely studied and known to be relatively high. At the same time, its out-of-plane thermal conductivity is significantly lower, but the precise difference is unknown. As such, I worked with frequency-domain thermoreflectance laser systems to categorize the energy dissipation rate.
        </p>
        <h3>Dry Transfer Stage Design and Manufacturing</h3>

           <p>
            The final project I worked on was the design of a Dry Transfer Stage to transfer samples of h-BN from glass slides to a silicon plate with incredibly high precision and various dynamic variables, such as high-temperature variation and delicate mounting methods.
        </p>  
          <p>
            This project was particularly difficult as the silicon plate (blue) placement must be consistent over time. The plate must be flush with the edge and level, but one can't use clamps or adhesives because the silicon is fragile and brittle. Additionally, the silicon plate must heat up to 200 degrees Celsius while the precise stages controlling movement cannot exceed 40 degrees Celsius. As a result, my design minimizes object profile and protrusions, allowing ample room for transfer and observation while cooling down the system to allow precision movements.        </p>

        <h3>Hexagonal Boron Nitride Synthesis</h3>

         <p>The second project I worked on was the synthesis of h-BN using molecular beam epitaxy. For this project, I was the only undergraduate member on a team of PhD students, Post-Docs, and Professional Scientists. As such, I had to work incredibly hard, reading and annotating 10+ research papers on the specific niche of h-BN crystal synthesis and the broader field to meaningfully contribute to the group. This effort paid off as I could identify irregularities in the required E-Beam power level throughout synthesis, as the power output would continuously rise throughout what should be a steady procedure. This ultimately led to the identification of issues with the eroding of the boron supply during the experiment, resulting in crucible damage. By identifying this potential danger early, potential hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage was mitigated.

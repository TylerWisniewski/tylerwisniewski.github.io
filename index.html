   			<h1>Hi!</h1>

   			<div class="intro-info">


   				<p class="lead">
            I'm Tyler Wisnieski, a first-generation Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I graduated with my Bachelor's 
            degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in May, 2025 and am currently pursuing my Master's in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell 
            and I'll be graduating in December, 2025.
          </p>
   				<p class="lead">
            My dad was a carpenter and I spent most weekends through highschool working with him installing windows, hauling drywall, building decks, 
            and any other number of odd jobs from week to week. As a result, I've developed a strong work ethic and a passion for building with the
            tools to make my visions a reality. I was already so used to thinking about how different parts of a physical system work together so 
            Mechanical Engineering seemed like the obvious choice for me and I've absoultely love it! 
          </p>
   				<p class="lead">I particularly love using engineering as a method to explore other areas of interest, too. Of course I've learned a how to think 
            and solve problems through my engineering coursework and practical experience thruough my project team and internships, but I've also learned 
            about seabed topography and whale physiology while designing surfboard fins, the importance of safety system controls while
            working on a nuclear fusion reactor simulation, and I've internalized more about Force and Moment balances while rock climbing than the hundreds 
            (thousands?) of hours I've spent grinding through problem sets.
          </p>
   				<p class="lead">I've found that my exploring other interests using engineering projects as a 
            medium for exploration has led to some of my most rewarding experiences and I've found parallels and connections between seemingly disparate fields 
            that I could have gone my whole life without ever noticing. This has been so much fun so far and I intend to keep exploring this way for the rest of my life. 
            Doing this for a living still feels surreal sometimes, but I love it and I can't wait to see where it takes me. 
          </p>
